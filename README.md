<h2>Process</h2>

The group came up with the idea for the buying and selling of sneakers from inspiration of many reseller sites and applications that already exist. This application is more shoe focused and only between users so it's a more personal operation for the user. The web site is called "DEADSTOCK" which refers to the stock which is left over in stores and needs to go. 

<h2>Topics</h2>
The functionality of the site includes:

* Profile pages
* Login pages
* Searching of sneakers in database
* Images along with up to date information of the sneakers from the database

<h2>Components</h2>
First, an idea was sketched with the main concept in mind that all four of us would be able to grasp and create in our heads to be able to visualize how this will be constructed fully. Tom and Kyle split up for the back end functionality and Dylan and Heather split up to work together on the front end and all four group members helped research all of the issues faced along the way. The sneaker API collects all information on the sneaker and displays them when searched for with the criteria provided on the site.

<h2>Tools</h2>

* Bootstrap
* Bulma
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Passport

<h2>Issues faced</h2>
Our group faced many issues like the API not functioning as expecting, first main idea for project being deemed as too ambitious for only one weeks time, and learning the new technology.
